The Noddity installer
=============

Install it globally `npm install -g noddity-installer`, browse to an empty directory where you want a fresh Noddity install, and just run `noddity`!

Setting up your site
-----------

Change the config.js file to fiddle with various settings, like what the page title should be.

Fiddle with the content directory to change the markdown content of various pages, and add file names to the index.json to have them show up in the post list on the left side.

If you want to enable the RSS feed, or tell search spiders to try to download static versions of the posts, edit the index.html file and uncomment/edit the lines at the top.
